Ngan:
In this piece, I try to give the circles a sense of life. They are like plankton cells, slowly drifting upwards, bumping into and "talking to" each other (i.e. instantaneous intersection).
I like it best when the encounter is very brief, and the cells show indecision and almost nervousness. I enjoy the strangely emotional qualities displayed in the movements of simple lines and dots, even though it's perhaps a kind of pathetic fallacy, if not childishness.
The sharp colour contrast makes the composition "blink" annoyingly, but I like the primitive and "nervous" qualities associated with it.

Hodgin:
The effect of this piece is quite organic. The movement and response of the circles is reminiscent of a cellular process. The dilation of the center lines is a nice effect. Helps to emphasize the interaction.

Tarbell:
The circles in this piece seem to be alive. While they experience multiple intersections with other circles, they seem to be able to choose a particular intersection to which they are most attracted. This kind of behavior is analogous to daily life, often forced into singular points of focus.
