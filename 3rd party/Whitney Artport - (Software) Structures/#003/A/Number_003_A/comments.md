from the [comments] on Structure #003A:

Reas:

The points moving on the screen are the center of each circle. The lines connect the intersections on the perimeter of overlapping circles. To emphasize the difference in line length, they increase in value from white to black as they grow longer. Because the edge of a circle is a nonlinear surface, the lines drawn from the intersections grow quickly, linger as they grow longer, and diminish quickly. When three or more circles simultaneously overlap, the illusion of depth increases as the resulting lines construct a corner.

Tarbell:

I most enjoy watching pairs of points approach each other until a line forms between them. Sometimes two points will drift in tandem carrying their line interface with them. The way in which the line's stroke fades with distance is quite nice.

Hodgin:

The interactions are relatively basic and expected until suddenly, a cube appears out of nowhere and disappears as quickly as it arrived. Very meditational.

Ngan:

There is something “musical” about this piece. I can feel a gentle rhythm in the variations of line movements.
