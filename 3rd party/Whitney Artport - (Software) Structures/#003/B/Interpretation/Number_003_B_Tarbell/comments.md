From the [comments] on Tarbell's Structure #003B:

Tarbell:
Circles of differing sizes draw variegated lines between their points of intersection. Circles move horizontally at fixed velocities. I
intentionally kept the movement of the circles simple because the drawing technique was already so complex that the underlying structure was lost. HINT: To view the structure behind the rendering, press the SPACEBAR.

Hodgin:
I have absolutely no idea what is going on here. I think that is part of
its charm. It feels very scientific, not unlike the mapping of DNA. Very structured in the beginning but incredibly chaotic after some time has passed. If it weren't for the presence of the occasional highly recognizable circle, I would assume that I was viewing a geological process of some sort.

Ngan:
It is amazing to see how a simple software structure can generate such complex and rich results. The beginning was particularly interesting: dots appeared sparsely, then small structures formed, and then a kind of imaginary landscape emerged. And I like the “wipes” made by the thin translucent threads that connect the intersection points.
