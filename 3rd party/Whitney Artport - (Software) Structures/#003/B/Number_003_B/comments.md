Reas:

Structure #003B is essentially like photographing 003A with the shutter left open for an extended period of time. It gives us a different vision into the structure by compressing changes over time into the same visual space. The transition of the line value from white to black is critical to avoid that the screen saturates itself entirely with black or white. The image created by this software is continually changing, erasing and re-drawing while never repeating.
Due to the slow speed in which the software runs, there are unfortunate gaps between the lines, thus degrading the quality of the image from the intended form.

Tarbell:

If I stare long enough at this piece, it almost seems as if older
intersection drawings are fading away.  Is this a result of some background fading algorithm or an illusion created by the contrast of additional drawing?  It's impossible for me to know (without looking at the code).  The spacious time in which the effect occurs is pleasing.

Hodgin:

For something based on interactions within a two-dimensional physical space, the result is surprisingly three-dimensional.

Ngan:

The forms derived from the line movements are very elegant and organic. The structure is complex yet subtle, and shows a great sense of depth. I know this is a work of abstraction, but I tend to see phantoms of cubist portraits emerging from the canvas â€“ fantastic and strange!
