**The Processing sketches contained in this folder represent the Whitney Artport commission *[{Software} Structures]*, created by Casey Reas in 2004**

The catalyst for this project is the work of Sol LeWitt, specifically his wall drawings. I had a simple question: "Is the history of conceptual art relevant to the idea of software as art?" I began to answer the question by implementing three of Lewitt's drawings in software and then making modifications.

After working with the LeWitt plans, I created three structures unique to software. These software structures are text descriptions outlining dynamic relations between elements. They develop in the vague domain of image and then mature in the more defined structures of natural language before any thought is given to a specific machine implementation.

Twenty-six pieces of software derived from these structures were written to isolate different components of software structures including interpretation, material, and process. For each, you may view the software, source code, and comments.

ed. notes, June 2014:

- The structures mentioned are named "#001", "#002", and "#003". Only the "#003" structure is represented here.
- The sketches were converted to Processing's new Python mode in June of 2014 by Ben Alkov.
