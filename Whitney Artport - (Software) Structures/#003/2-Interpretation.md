from [Interpretation]:

When a piece of music is performed, the musician interprets the composer's score according to her own ideas and in relation to the composer's intent. This relation became more pronounced in the 1960s through the work of composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen. Umberto Eco wrote in 1962:

>A number of recent pieces of instrumental music are linked by a common feature: the considerable autonomy left to the individual performer in the way he chooses to play the work. Thus, he is not merely free to interpret the composer's instructions following his own discretion (which in fact happens in traditional music), but he must impose his judgement on the form of the piece.

When Sol LeWitt introduced his systemic drawings, a similar relation entered the visual arts. In *Doing Wall Drawings* LeWitt wrote, "The draftsman perceives the artist's plan, then reorders it to his experience and understanding" and "The artist and the draftsman become collaborators in making the art." The degree of interpretive freedom an artist gives to the person executing the work is specific to each piece. Regardless, there is a deep structure that reveals the intention of the author. For this project, three individuals implemented Software Structure #003 without communication or knowledge of the others' direction and without knowledge of the original implementation.
