Many of us have seen the romantic photographs of Jackson Pollock hunched over the canvas at his studio with a paint can in one hand and a brush in the other. He intently moves across the floor while dripping paint on the canvas as a painting slowly emerges. Through this type of romanticized media imagery, people have glimpsed the process of creating paintings, sculptures, and other traditional arts. The process of creating software is a mysterious practice with few references in popular culture and art discourse. Software is a very fragile material and working within its rigid syntax and structural rules can be very tedious for people who love to directly engage with physical materials. Writing software is a process of translating fuzzy ideas from one's mind into a strict notational system. Using this notation as an intermediate step, visual and kinetic ideas manifest themselves in computational machines. As with other types of art, software may be written through a process of intuitive exploration, and it can be written precisely to meet a goal.

I have chosen to reveal a series of steps in the implementation of Software Structure #003. While each successive piece is an increasingly complex technical study, the form of the final work slowly reveals itself and as in most evolutionary processes, it typically progresses in quick leaps rather than a continual incline. There were hundreds of separate versions of this software as it progressed over a period of two weeks. For clarity, ten representative steps have been selected to show the software's development.

ed. notes, June 2014:

- The sketches representing the process steps are in the Process folder. They seem to primarily relate to Variation "A".
