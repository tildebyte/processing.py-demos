Ngan:
In this piece, I imagine a field (of lines) through which invisible circles wade and thereby disturb it.

The circles emerge in the field, one after another, and slowly spread out. When two circles intersect, the lines that the two circles overlay will point towards the intersection point. As a whole, I think the composition is quite rich in texture and organic. A larger canvas may better render the effect, but it makes my computer very tired indeed.

Tarbell:
The gentle development of this work is enjoyable to watch. It is hard for me to perceive where the intersections are actually occurring until the entire field has been 'disrupted.' Is this how crop circles are formed?

Hodgin:
Starts out so predictably and evolves quickly into something that cannot be easily deconstructed.
